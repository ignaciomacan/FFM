    "# Fama–French Five-Factor Model  \n",
    "### (Replication Project Summary – Econ 430, Project 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## What the Model Is About\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the **Fama–French Five-Factor Model** basically expands on the classic **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** and the earlier **Three-Factor Model** to better explain *why* some stocks earn higher average returns than others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Where CAPM only looks at the **market risk premium**, Fama and French add four more dimensions that capture differences in firm size, value, profitability, and investment behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model’s expected-return equation looks like this:\n",
    "$\n",
    "R_{it} - R_{ft} = \\alpha_i + \n",
    "\\beta_{i,M}(R_{Mt} - R_{ft}) +\n",
    "\\beta_{i,SMB} \\, SMB_t +\n",
    "\\beta_{i,HML} \\, HML_t +\n",
    "\\beta_{i,RMW} \\, RMW_t +\n",
    "\\beta_{i,CMA} \\, CMA_t + \\varepsilon_{it}\n",
    "$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Symbol | Meaning |\n",
    "|:-------:|:--------|\n",
    "| $( R_{it} )$ | Return on portfolio or stock *i* |\n",
    "| $( R_{ft} )$ | Risk-free rate (often T-bill) |\n",
    "| $( R_{Mt} - R_{ft} )$ | Market excess return |\n",
    "| **SMB** | “Small minus Big” — small-cap minus large-cap returns (size effect) |\n",
    "| **HML** | “High minus Low” — value minus growth returns (book-to-market effect) |\n",
    "| **RMW** | “Robust minus Weak” — firms with high vs. low profitability |\n",
    "| **CMA** | “Conservative minus Aggressive” — firms with low vs. high investment activity |\n",
    "| $( \\alpha_i )$ | Intercept or “abnormal return” |\n",
    "| $( \\varepsilon_{it} )$ | Error term |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Fama and French argued that the market factor alone (from CAPM) misses patterns investors clearly observe in the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Small-cap stocks** tend to outperform big-cap ones.  \n",
    "- **Value stocks** (high book-to-market) often outperform growth stocks.  \n",
    "- Firms with **strong profitability** outperform weak ones.  \n",
    "- Firms that **invest conservatively** (don’t expand aggressively) earn higher returns than heavy-investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these five factors aim to explain most of the variation in average stock returns across portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## What Replicating This Project Involves\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our Econ 430 Project 2 is about *replicating an empirical study*, our goal is to **recreate the original data construction and regressions from Fama and French (2015)** using their public data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps are roughly:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️ Data Acquisition  \n",
    "- Download the **“Fama/French 5 Factors (2×3)”** dataset from [Kenneth R. French’s Data Library](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html).  \n",
    "- It includes monthly and annual factor returns for the U.S. since 1963:  \n",
    "  `MKT-RF`, `SMB`, `HML`, `RMW`, `CMA`, and `RF` (risk-free rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️ Data Preparation  \n",
    "- Import the dataset (CSV or TXT) into Python or R.  \n",
    "- Convert monthly dates, ensure numeric formatting, and merge with test-portfolio returns (e.g., 25 size–value portfolios).  \n",
    "- Compute **excess returns**:  \n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  R_{p,t}^{excess} = R_{p,t} - R_{f,t}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️ Model Estimation  \n",
    "- Run the time-series regression for each portfolio:  \n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  R_{p,t}^{excess} = \\alpha_p + \\beta_{MKT} (MKT-RF)_t + \\beta_{SMB} SMB_t + \\beta_{HML} HML_t + \\beta_{RMW} RMW_t + \\beta_{CMA} CMA_t + \\varepsilon_{p,t}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "- Use `statsmodels` or `linearmodels` in Python to estimate coefficients, standard errors, and \\( R^2 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4️ Replication Comparison  \n",
    "- Compare your regression results (coefficients, t-stats, \\( R^2 \\)) to the published paper or to French’s benchmark tables.  \n",
    "- Evaluate whether your signs, magnitudes, and significance levels match.  \n",
    "- Document any discrepancies and possible reasons (updated data, rounding, or sample period differences).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5️ Critical Analysis  \n",
    "After replication, we’ll **critically evaluate** whether the five factors truly capture all priced risk:\n",
    "- Are profitability (RMW) and investment (CMA) statistically significant in our sample?\n",
    "- Does the model reduce the unexplained alpha relative to the three-factor version?\n",
    "- Are there portfolios (e.g., momentum stocks) the model still fails to explain?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Project Fits the Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "This replication fits **Econ 430 Project 2** perfectly because:\n",
    "- It’s a **widely cited empirical paper** in a **top-tier finance journal** (*Journal of Financial Economics*, 2015).  \n",
    "- The data are **publicly available** from Kenneth French’s website — no proprietary access issues.  \n",
    "- It uses **OLS time-series regressions**, exactly matching our course techniques.  \n",
    "- It has **clear variable definitions**, so we can document data cleaning, transformations, and diagnostics as required in the rubric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plus, it’s economically meaningful: it helps explain **how profitability and investment behavior influence expected returns**, which connects to real-world portfolio management and asset pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "By replicating the Fama–French Five-Factor Model, our group will:\n",
    "- Practice **empirical asset-pricing estimation** in Python.  \n",
    "- Learn to **diagnose model quality** (e.g., R², heteroskedasticity, t-tests).  \n",
    "- Gain experience in **comparing published results** to independent replication.  \n",
    "- And critically evaluate whether adding more factors truly improves our understanding of market returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project isn’t just about copying results — it’s about learning *how empirical finance research is actually built, tested, and questioned.*\n",
