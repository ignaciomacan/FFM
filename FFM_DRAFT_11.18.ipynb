    "# 1. Original Study Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## (a) Research Question: Clearly state the paper’s main research question and economic Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern asset-pricing began with a simple premise: if markets are competitive and information flows freely, prices should adjust to news and leave no predictable profit opportunities. This idea is what became the **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**. EMH emerged in the 1950s and 60s out of early empirical work showing that stock returns had almost no autocorrelation, suggesting prices behave like a fair game responding only to new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decade later, Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965) formalized the first equilibrium model linking risk to expected returns: the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**. Its prediction was:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1) CAPM Formula**  \n",
    "\\[$\n",
    "E[R_i] - R_f = \\beta_i\\,(E[R_M] - R_f)\n",
    "$\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "With **beta** as the sole predictor of cross-sectional differences in average returns. For 20 years this model remained empirically reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as Fama repeatedly emphasizes, CAPM’s “golden age” was short. By the early 1980s and into the 1990s, empirical papers accumulated showing that beta alone could not explain average returns sorted on firm **size** (Banz 1981), **earnings-price ratios** (Basu 1977), **leverage** (Bhandari 1988), or **book-to-market** (Rosenberg, Reif & Lanstein 1985). Additional patterns such as long-term reversals (DeBondt & Thaler 1985) and the January effect (Keim 1983) reinforced the conclusion that CAPM missed persistent dimensions of return variance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These anomalies eventually shifted professional consensus. As the *New York Times* summarized in 1992—reflecting the conclusions of Fama and French—“beta as the sole variable explaining returns on stocks is dead.” (Berg 1992)\n",
    "\n",
    "These empirical failures exposed a deeper theoretical problem: CAPM offered too narrow a representation of risk. Asset-pricing models required additional dimensions to explain why some portfolios earned persistently higher returns than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Eugene Fama and Kenneth French aimed at capturing these missing dimensions, they developed the **Fama–French Three-Factor Model (1993)**. In it they augmented the market factor with size (SMB: small minus big) and value (HML: high minus low book-to-market):\n",
    "\n",
    "**(2) Fama–French Three-Factor Formula**  \n",
    "\\[$\n",
    "R_i - R_f = \\alpha_i + \\beta_i (R_M - R_f) + s_i\\,\\text{SMB} + h_i\\,\\text{HML} + \\varepsilon_i\n",
    "$\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "What the Three-Factor Model aims to answer is: can size (SMB) and value (HML) jointly explain the cross-section of average returns better than CAPM?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "After the Three-Factor Model (1993), Fama and French showed that SMB and HML captured important patterns that CAPM could not explain. But the model was still incomplete: it summarized the data, yet it did not explain **why** these patterns existed. Subsequent work showed that **profitability** and **investment** were also strongly related to average returns and were not absorbed by the three factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for revisiting the model comes directly from the **dividend discount model**, which expresses a stock’s price as the present value of expected future dividends:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3) Dividend Discount Model**  \n",
    "\\[$\n",
    "P_t = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{E_t[D_{t+j}]}{(1+r)^j}\n",
    "$\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The DDM can be rewritten in terms of future earnings and changes in book equity:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(4) \\(M_t\\)**  \n",
    "\\[$\n",
    "M_t = \\frac{B_{t+1} - B_t + D_{t+1}}{E_t[R_{t+1}]}\n",
    "$\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies three core relationships:\n",
    "- A higher book-to-market ratio is associated with **higher expected returns**  \n",
    "- Higher expected profitability is associated with **higher expected returns**  \n",
    "- Higher expected investment (growth in book equity) is associated with **lower expected returns**\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads directly to the research question in the **Five-Factor Model of Fama and French (2014):**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **“Do profitability and investment add explanatory power beyond the three-factor model?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "The economic interpretation is straightforward: if expected returns are tied to how firms earn profits and reinvest capital, then an empirical model that omits these drivers is incomplete. The purpose of the five-factor model is to test whether incorporating **profitability (RMW)** and **investment (CMA)** produces a model better aligned with underlying expected returns.\n"

    "The primary economic theory that the paper's analysis is based on is the dividend discount model. The authors state this directly: \"We can use the dividend discount model to explain why these variables are related to average returns.” (Fama and French, 2014, p. 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This model states that the price of the stock is the discounted value of its expected future dividends. The authors then mathematically rearrange this model into a valuation equation (Equation 3) that expresses the ratio of a firm's market value to its book value (Mt /Bt ) as a function of its expected future earnings and expected future investments (changes in book equity) .\n",
    "\n",
    "This valuation equation provides the theoretical justification for the new factors by generating three specific predictions about expected returns . As the paper states:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Eq. (3) makes three statements about expected stock returns. First, fix everything in (3) except the current value of the stock, Mt , and the expected stock return, r. Then a lower value of Mt , or equivalently a higher book-to-market equity ratio, Bt /Mt , implies a higher expected return. Next, fix Mt  and the values of everything in (3) except expected future earnings and the expected stock return. The equation then tells us that higher expected earnings imply a higher expected return. Finally, for fixed values of Bt , Mt , and expected earnings, higher expected growth in book equity investment implies a lower expected return.\" (Fama and French, 2014, p. 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the dividend discount model provides the theoretical basis for why value (high B/M), profitability (high earnings), and investment (low investment) should all be related to higher average stock returns. These three predictions are the \"natural choices\" that motivate adding profitability and investment factors to the model.\t"

    "The paper's core model specification is the five-factor asset pricing model. The authors explicitly define this in a regression equation:\n",
    "\"Motivated by this evidence and the valuation Eq. (3), we add profitability and investment factors to the three-factor model:\n",
    "$R_{it}-R_{Ft}=a_{i}+b_{i}(R_{Mt}-R_{Ft})+s_{i}SMB_{t}+h_{i}HML_{t}+r_{i}RMW_{t}+c_{i}CMA_{t}+e_{it}$\" (Fama and French, 2014, p. 3)\n",

The independent variables are the five factors: the market excess return ($R_{Mt}−R_{Ft}$), the size factor ($SMBt$), the value factor ($HMLt$), the profitability factor ($RMWt$), and the investment factor ($CMAt$).\n",
    "The estimation technique used is a time-series regression. This regression is run for each of the left-hand-side ($LHS$) portfolios (e.g., the 25 Size-B/M portfolios) against the five factor returns on the right-hand-side ($RHS$). The output of this estimation provides the factor loadings (the b, s, h, r, and c coefficients) for each portfolio, as well as the intercept, $a_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The econometric approach is designed to test how well the model explains average returns. The central hypothesis of this approach is that the model's factors should capture all systematic variation in average returns, leaving no unexplained portion. The paper states this testable implication clearly:\n",

    "$R_M−R_F$ (Market): 1.12% vs. 0.50%.\n",

    "**Potential Reasons:** The post-2013 data included in my sample covers several periods of extreme market volatility that are not in the paper's 1963-2013 sample. This includes the market shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic, the subsequent high-inflation environment, and the aggressive interest rate hike cycle. These events would explain both the higher average returns (driven by strong recoveries) and the much higher standard deviations seen in my sample's descriptive statistics.\n",
