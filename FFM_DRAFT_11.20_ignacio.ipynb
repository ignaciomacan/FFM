    "Modern asset-pricing began with a simple premise: if markets are competitive and information flows freely, prices should adjust to news and leave no predictable profit opportunities. This idea is what became the **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**. EMH emerged in the 1950s and 60s out of early empirical work showing that stock returns had almost no autocorrelation, suggesting prices behave like a fair game responding only to new information.\n",

    "CAPM originally told us that one thing explains expected returns: **market risk**. \n",

    "With **beta** as the sole predictor of cross-sectional differences in average returns. For 20 years this model remained empirically reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "But as Fama repeatedly emphasizes, CAPM’s “golden age” was short. By the early 1980s and into the 1990s, empirical papers accumulated showing that the relationship between market betas and average returns was basically \"flat\", but according to CAPM it couldn't be flat, average returns should increase with market beta. So beta alone could not explain average returns sorted on firm **size** (Banz 1981), **earnings-price ratios** (Basu 1977), **leverage** (Bhandari 1988), or **book-to-market** (Rosenberg, Reif & Lanstein 1985).\n",
    "\n",
    "These accumulating anomalies eventually shifted professional consensus. In a 1992 New York Times article based on a phone interview with Eugene Fama, he stated that “beta as the sole variable explaining returns on stocks is dead” (Berg 1992).\n",
    "\n",
    "These empirical failures exposed a deeper theoretical problem: CAPM offered too narrow a representation of risk. Asset pricing models required additional dimensions to explain why some portfolios earned persistently higher returns than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Eugene Fama and Kenneth French aimed at capturing these missing dimensions, they developed the **Fama–French Three-Factor Model (1993)**, which looked at the two biggest anomalies for the CAPM, which was it's inability to explain small stock returns and the difference between value and growth stock returns. That's why in the Three Factor Model they augmented the market factor with size (SMB: small minus big) and value (HML: high minus low book-to-market):\n",

    "**Can the cross section of average stock returns be better explained by adding size and value factors to the market factor, thereby accounting for the persistent return premiums observed for small firms and high book to market firms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "After the Three-Factor Model (1993), Fama and French showed that the size and value factors **SMB** and **HML** captured important patterns that the CAPM could not explain. Small firms earned higher average returns than big firms (**size premium**), and high book to market firms earned higher returns than growth firms (**value premium**). In the three-factor framework, these effects appear through the parameters $( s_i )$ and $( h_i )$:\n",

    " $( s_i > 0 )$ for small firms and $( s_i < 0 )$ for big firms  \n",
    " $( h_i > 0 )$ for high book-to-market (value) firms\n",
    "\n",
    "But the model was still incomplete as evident by Novy-Marx (2012), Titman, Wei and Xie (2004) which say that the Three Factor is incomplete model for expected returns because its three factors miss much of the variation in average returns related to profitability and investment. \n",

    "**holding other characteristics constant**, a firm with higher expected profitability should have a higher required return $( r )$. Put differently, if two firms have similar book equity $( B )$ but one has higher expected earnings or cash flows, the valuation identity implies a positive link between profitability and expected returns. Empirically, portfolios sorted on operating profitability $(\\text{OP})$ showed exactly this pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, investment behavior carries information about expected returns. In standard steady state valuation, higher investment $( I_t )$ relative to assets $( A_t )$ (i.e., high asset growth) is typically associated with lower expected returns because firms invest more when their marginal $( q )$ is low. This motivates a negative relation between investment and expected returns. Fama and French operationalize this using the investment factor:\n",

We estimate factor loadings (aka the time-series regression slopes) using time-series OLS regressions of portfolio excess returns on factor returns, and we evaluate model performance through the main diagnostics used in Fama and French (1993, 2015): the magnitude and significance of intercepts, the signs and t-statistics of factor loadings, the regression $R^2$ values that indicate how much common variation the factors capture, and the joint GRS test of whether all alphas are zero. We also compare models using the variance of the estimated alphas $alpha_i$, and examine whether adding profitability and investment factors reduces the magnitude and cross-sectional variance of these pricing errors across the 25 portfolio and 32 portfolio sorts.\n",

    "(e) Main Findings: Authors’ Primary Empirical Results and Conclusions\n",
    "</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "The central empirical finding of Fama and French (2015) is that the Five-Factor Model offers a substantial improvement over the original Three-Factor Model. As they write, *“A five-factor model directed at capturing the size, value, profitability, and investment patterns in average stock returns performs better than the three-factor model of Fama and French (1993).”* The addition of profitability (RMW) and investment (CMA) factors sharply increases explanatory power and reduces the magnitude of pricing errors across most portfolio sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this improvement, the model is not a perfect description of the data. The GRS test rejects the model as a complete asset-pricing model, even though its economic fit is strong. The authors note, *“The GRS test easily rejects a five-factor model directed at capturing these patterns, but we estimate that the model explains between 71% and 94% of the cross-section variance of expected returns for the Size, B/M, OP, and Inv portfolios we examine.”* In other words, the model is statistically rejected but economically powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most notable findings is that the profitability and investment factors render the original value factor (HML) redundant. The authors state directly that, *“With the addition of profitability and investment factors, the value factor of the FF three-factor model becomes redundant for describing average returns in the sample we examine.”* This redundancy arises because HML’s high average return can be almost entirely explained by its exposures to the other factors:  \n",
    "*“…our results suggest that HML is a redundant factor in the sense that its high average return is fully captured by its exposures to $R_M - R_F$, SMB, and especially RMW and CMA.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "This result highlights the theoretical success of the new factors:  \n",
    "- **Profitability (RMW)** is strongly and positively related to average returns.  \n",
    "- **Investment (CMA)** is strongly negatively related to average returns (firms investing aggressively earn lower returns).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these two factors subsume the information HML was capturing about cash-flow risk and investment behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Five-Factor Model also has a clear and well-defined failure. Fama and French describe this as the model’s *“lethal”* problem: its inability to explain the very low average returns on certain small, distressed firms. These are portfolios made up of small firms that **invest heavily despite having low profitability**, and they consistently generate pricing errors that the model cannot account for. As the authors write, *“Portfolios of small stocks with negative exposures to RMW and CMA are the biggest asset pricing problem in four of the six sets of LHS portfolios examined here.”* They conclude, *“…we find that the lethal portfolios contain small stocks of firms that invest a lot despite low profitability.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main empirical outcomes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Five-Factor Model substantially improves upon the Three-Factor Model.  \n",
    "- Profitability (RMW) is a powerful, economically meaningful factor with a strong positive relation to returns.  \n",
    "- Investment (CMA) is also important, though it introduces challenges in capturing low-return, high-investment small firms.  \n",
    "- The value factor (HML) becomes redundant once RMW and CMA are introduced.  \n",
    "- Despite its successes, the model is still rejected statistically and fails most clearly for small, unprofitable, high-investment firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings form the basis of the paper’s contribution: a more complete but still imperfect model of the cross-section of expected returns.\n"

    "This section describes the procedures used to transform the raw data downloaded from the Kenneth R. French Data Library. Although the factor returns (RHS variables) and portfolio returns (LHS variables) originate from different files, they suffer from the same non ideal formatting for replicability of the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this stage is to replicate the structure and sample period used by Fama and French (2015), who analyze monthly data from July 1963 through December 2013. Since the French Data Library provides continuously updated datasets extending through 2025, all observations after December 2013 were deliberately removed to be within the original analysis.\n",

    "Data Processing Format:\n",
    "</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "This will apply to both factor returns and portfolio returns because it's all from the same source and they will all follow the same conceptual preprocessing steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Removal of non-data header rows**  \n",
    "   Raw CSV files include descriptive metadata and explanatory text at the top of the file. These rows were excluded using the `skiprows` argument and further filtered by retaining only observations with valid numeric date identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Standardization of variable names**  \n",
    "   To promote clarity and consistency across datasets, variables were renamed (e.g., `\"Mkt-RF\"` to `\"MKTRF\"` and `\"Unnamed: 0\"` to `\"date\"`), and only relevant columns were retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conversion to numeric data types**  \n",
    "   All factor returns, portfolio returns, and risk-free rates were explicitly converted to numeric formats to prevent implicit coercion during regression estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Date alignment and merging**  \n",
    "   Factor and portfolio datasets were merged on the monthly date variable using an inner join. This ensures that each observation corresponds to the same calendar month across all variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sample truncation to December 2013**  \n",
    "   After merging, observations occurring after 2013:12 were removed to match the sample window used in the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Construction of excess returns**  \n",
    "   Portfolio excess returns were computed as the difference between portfolio returns and the risk-free rate:\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   R_{it}^{excess} = R_{it} - R_{ft}\n",
    "   $\n",
    "   This transformation is required because all Fama–French regressions are estimated in excess return form.\n",

    "### Overview\n",
    "This section compares our constructed portfolio return statistics against those reported in Fama and French (2015) for the same sample window, July 1963 through December 2013 with 606 monthly observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "All comparisons below refer exclusively to differences in reported means and implied cross sectional distributions of average excess returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. 25-Portfolios: Size × B/M, Size × OP, Size × Investment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Panel A: Size × Book-to-Market\n",
    "\n",
    "Our mean excess returns closely track those reported in the original paper. Across most cells the differences are within approximately 0.01 to 0.05 percentage points. The overall cross sectional shape is preserved, with higher returns concentrated in small and high B/M portfolios and lower returns among big and low B/M portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest deviations appear in Big size portfolios, particularly in mid to high B/M categories. For example, Big portfolios in the third and fourth B/M columns show differences of around 0.05 to 0.06 relative to the original. While still small in magnitude, these are the most visible within this panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reported range of mean excess returns in our results is 0.2681 to 1.1138, which closely mirrors the original distribution. The dispersion and ranking of returns across the grid remain highly consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#122DAC; font-weight:bold;\">Overall assessment:</span> Excellent replication with only minor numeric drift in Big portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Panel B: Size × Operating Profitability\n",
    "\n",
    "Our values again remain very close to the original, with cell level deviations generally below 0.05. The majority of differences occur among Big portfolios, where our returns are modestly lower in both low and high profitability cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, Big low profitability and Big high profitability portfolios show differences around 0.03 to 0.04. Middle size categories also exhibit small deviations but remain tightly aligned across all columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The range of our reported returns spans 0.3469 to 0.9919 which is nearly identical to the original dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#122DAC; font-weight:bold;\">Overall assessment:</span> Strong agreement with small downward shifts concentrated in Big portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Panel C: Size × Investment\n",
    "\n",
    "This panel presents the closest match of all three 25-portfolio constructions. Most cells are either identical or differ by at most 0.01 to 0.02. The Small portfolios match almost perfectly across all Investment levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum and minimum values nearly coincide with the original table, and the overall distribution appears indistinguishable at a practical level.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#122DAC; font-weight:bold;\">Overall assessment:</span> Near-perfect replication with negligible discrepancies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. 32-Portfolios: 2 × 4 × 4 Three-Way Sorts\n",
    "\n",
    "This set exhibits noticeably greater variation compared to the 25-portfolio results. While broad cross sectional patterns remain intact, numeric differences become more pronounced as portfolio dimensionality increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Panel A: Size × B/M × OP\n",
    "\n",
    "Small portfolios show good alignment with differences primarily within 0.02 to 0.06. Minor understatements appear in the lowest OP and highest B/M combinations but remain modest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big portfolios show larger deviations. Several cells differ by 0.05 to 0.10. Particularly visible are portfolios combining Low OP with Low B/M and High OP with High B/M. The upper bound of the Big portfolio returns is slightly lower in our version, suggesting a compressed range.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#122DAC; font-weight:bold;\">Overall assessment:</span> Acceptable replication for Small portfolios, with more noticeable compression in Big portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Panel B: Size × B/M × Investment\n",
    "\n",
    "Small portfolios continue to track the original well, though modest understatements occur in higher B/M buckets. Differences typically range from 0.02 to 0.07.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Big portfolios display slightly larger variation. For instance, Low Investment and high B/M combinations are consistently lower in our results by roughly 0.06 to 0.08. Nevertheless, the ranking of portfolios remains aligned and no sign reversals occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#122DAC; font-weight:bold;\">Overall assessment:</span> Good structural alignment with small compression in the upper tail of Big portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Panel C: Size × OP × Investment\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the most substantial discrepancies appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Small portfolios are systematically lower across nearly every cell when compared to the original. Differences frequently exceed 0.10 and in some cases approach 0.25. The highest return portfolios in the original do not achieve the same magnitudes in our version, resulting in a clearly reduced upper bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big portfolios show even more pronounced compression. Numerous cells are lower by 0.20 to 0.35 relative to the published values. The entire Big portfolio grid exhibits a downward shift, especially for combinations involving low Investment and high Operating Profitability. The minimum values are slightly more negative than the original, while the maximum values are considerably lower.\n",

    "### Factor Means, Volatility, and t-Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Our factor summary statistics replicate the original Fama and French values very closely, with only minor numerical drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Means**\n",
    "All five factor means align almost exactly with the original table. The maximum deviation is 0.01. SMB is marginally lower in our results, while HML and RMW are slightly higher. These differences do not change factor ordering or economic scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Standard Deviations**\n",
    "Volatility levels are also tightly matched. The largest deviation appears for HML, where our standard deviation is 2.79 compared to the original 2.88. RMW is slightly more volatile in our data, while the remaining factors differ by 0.03 or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "**t-Statistics**\n",
    "t-statistics remain highly consistent. The largest difference is observed for HML, where our value of 3.38 exceeds the original 3.20. All other factors differ by less than 0.06, preserving both magnitude and inference regarding statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the factor distribution in our data mirrors the original with high precision and no meaningful distortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation Plot of Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation structure across factors is broadly preserved, with nearly identical signs and relative magnitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most pairwise correlations fall within 0.02–0.03 of the published values. The most noticeable difference occurs between RMW and CMA, where our correlation of -0.05 is less negative than the original -0.11. Despite this, the qualitative relationship remains consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strongest positive association remains between HML and CMA at 0.70 in both datasets, while MKTRF retains its expected negative relationship with CMA and HML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the correlation matrix maintains the same structural pattern as the original, with only small numerical softening in a few off-diagonal entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Description Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Y-side summary statistics demonstrate strong overall consistency with Fama and French (2015), particularly for simpler portfolio constructions such as the 25 Size × Investment and 25 Size × B/M portfolios. In these cases, both the magnitude and distribution of average excess returns align closely with the published results, preserving the same cross-sectional ordering and economic interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest deviations appear in the most granular three-way sorts, specifically those based on Size, Operating Profitability, and Investment. In these portfolios, our results are systematically lower and less dispersed than those reported in the original study. This compression is most visible among Big portfolios and in combinations involving low Investment and high Operating Profitability, where mean differences are noticeably larger than in the simpler sorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these differences do not alter the qualitative structure of the results, they suggest that the replication environment is not perfectly identical to that of the original publication. One plausible contributor is the evolution of the data available through Kenneth French’s Data Library. The datasets currently distributed in 2025 may not be identical to the versions used by Fama and French in their 2014 research paper. Even subtle upstream revisions, such as changes in CRSP corrections, firm classifications, or updated handling of delistings and corporate actions, can propagate into portfolio formation and slightly shift average returns, particularly in more finely sorted portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional sources of divergence may stem from small implementation differences, including portfolio construction timing, RF treatment, rounding conventions, or the precise filtering of monthly observations. These factors tend to exert minimal influence on broad portfolio groups but become more visible when returns are broken down into highly specific cells as in the 2 × 4 × 4 sorts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the observed discrepancies appear quantitative rather than structural. The patterns, monotonic relationships, and economic interpretation of the portfolios remain consistent with the original framework, reinforcing that our replication successfully captures the core empirical behavior of the Fama-French five-factor model while naturally reflecting the realities of modern data availability and updated source series.\n",

    "(d) Variable Construction\n",
    "</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this replication project relies on factor and portfolio return series downloaded directly from Kenneth R. French’s Data Library, where all factor construction and portfolio sorting procedures are already implemented, it is still important to document the underlying methodology used in the original Fama & French (2015) paper. Doing so clarifies the economic meaning of the variables and ensures transparency regarding how these series would be constructed if raw firm level data were used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework describes how the Fama French factors are constructed when using 2 × 3 independent sorts on firm characteristics. Stocks are assigned to portfolios based on Size and one secondary characteristic, either Book to Market (B/M), Operating Profitability (OP), or Investment (Inv).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sort Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Firms are sorted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary sort  \n",
    "Size, using the NYSE median market capitalization  \n",
    "This divides firms into Small (S) and Big (B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondary sort  \n",
    "30th and 70th NYSE percentiles of the relevant characteristic:\n",
    "\n",
    "Book to Market → High (H), Neutral (N), Low (L)  \n",
    "Operating Profitability → Robust (R), Neutral (N), Weak (W)  \n",
    "Investment → Conservative (C), Neutral (N), Aggressive (A)\n",
    "\n",
    "This produces 6 portfolios per characteristic combination, or 2 × 3 portfolios.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Construction of SMB\n",
    "\n",
    "Three versions of SMB are created from the different characteristic sorts:\n",
    "\n",
    "SMB<sub>B/M</sub> = (SH + SN + SL)/3 − (BH + BN + BL)/3  \n",
    "SMB<sub>OP</sub> = (SR + SN + SW)/3 − (BR + BN + BW)/3  \n",
    "SMB<sub>Inv</sub> = (SC + SN + SA)/3 − (BC + BN + BA)/3  \n",
    "\n",
    "The final SMB factor is the average of these three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "SMB = (SMB<sub>B/M</sub> + SMB<sub>OP</sub> + SMB<sub>Inv</sub>) / 3\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Construction of HML\n",
    "\n",
    "HML captures the return spread between high and low book to market firms:\n",
    "\n",
    "HML = (SH + BH)/2 − (SL + BL)/2  \n",
    "HML = [(SH − SL) + (BH − BL)] / 2\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Construction of RMW\n",
    "\n",
    "RMW measures the profitability premium between firms with robust and weak operating profitability:\n",
    "\n",
    "RMW = (SR + BR)/2 − (SW + BW)/2  \n",
    "RMW = [(SR − SW) + (BR − BW)] / 2\n",

    "\n",
    "### Construction of CMA\n",
    "\n",
    "CMA captures the investment premium between conservative and aggressive firms:\n",

    "CMA = (SC + BC)/2 − (SA + BA)/2  \n",
    "CMA = [(SC − SA) + (BC − BA)] / 2\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Portfolio Label Key\n",

    "### Conceptual Difference Between 5 × 5 and 2 × 4 × 4 Portfolio Sorts\n",
    "\n",
    "The dependent variables in the empirical tests are portfolio excess returns, and these portfolios are constructed using different sorting schemes depending on the purpose of the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 5 × 5 sorts represent the core test portfolios. Firms are sorted into five size groups and five characteristic groups, producing 25 portfolios. Conceptually, this can be thought of as a grid where each cell represents firms that share similar size and similar levels of a given characteristic such as B/M, profitability, or investment. These portfolios form the primary set used to evaluate how well the factor model explains returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2 × 4 × 4 sorts follow a different logic. Firms are first split into Small and Big groups, and then each of those groups is independently sorted into four groups based on two characteristics. This results in 32 portfolios. These sorts are used primarily as robustness tests. The goal is not to replace the main 5 × 5 structure but to examine whether the factor model continues to perform well when size is controlled more sharply and when interactions between characteristics such as value, profitability, and investment are observed more directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, the 2 × 4 × 4 portfolios allow the authors to explore whether performance differences across portfolios are truly driven by the intended risk factors or whether they are influenced by overlapping or confounding firm characteristics. These tests provide additional evidence about the stability and reliability of the model’s explanatory power.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This construction procedure ensures that each factor isolates a specific dimension of firm characteristic risk while maintaining consistency across sorting schemes. In this replication, all factors and portfolio returns were sourced directly from the Kenneth French Data Library in their pre constructed form. However, the conceptual foundation and construction logic follow exactly the procedures described in Fama & French (2015).\n"

    "Missing data is not a concern for the primary time-series dataset used in this analysis. The descriptive statistics for our final sample (N = 606) show identical observation counts across all variables, indicating that no missing values (NaN) remain in the factor return series after preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is consistent with the methodology of the original paper. Fama and French (2015) do not impute missing data; instead, they address it through sample construction. Their portfolios are formed using “all NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ stocks on both CRSP and Compustat” that meet strict data availability requirements for variables such as Size and Book-to-Market. Firms lacking the required accounting or market data are excluded prior to portfolio formation, ensuring that the resulting factor returns are based only on complete observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two practical considerations of “missing data” arose during replication:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exclusion of Extreme Robustness Sorts**  \n",
    "   The most granular portfolio sorts (e.g., 2×2 and 2×2×2×2 dimensions), which serve as extreme robustness checks in the original study, were not included due to time constraints. Per guidance from Professor Rojas, these robustness extensions were not required for this replication and their exclusion does not affect the core validation of the five-factor model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while no missing observations exist within the finalized dataset itself, non-essential robustness portfolios might have influenced replication of the original empirical design."
