    "Modern asset-pricing began with a simple premise: if markets are competitive and information flows freely, prices should adjust to news and leave no predictable profit opportunities. This idea is what became the **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**. EMH emerged in the 1950s and 60s out of early empirical work showing that stock returns had almost no autocorrelation, suggesting prices behave like a fair game responding only to new information.\n",

    "CAPM originally told us that one thing explains expected returns: **market risk**. \n",

    "With **beta** as the sole predictor of cross-sectional differences in average returns. For 20 years this model remained empirically reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "But as Fama repeatedly emphasizes, CAPM’s “golden age” was short. By the early 1980s and into the 1990s, empirical papers accumulated showing that the relationship between market betas and average returns was basically \"flat\", but according to CAPM it couldn't be flat, average returns should increase with market beta. So beta alone could not explain average returns sorted on firm **size** (Banz 1981), **earnings-price ratios** (Basu 1977), **leverage** (Bhandari 1988), or **book-to-market** (Rosenberg, Reif & Lanstein 1985).\n",
    "\n",
    "These accumulating anomalies eventually shifted professional consensus. In a 1992 New York Times article based on a phone interview with Eugene Fama, he stated that “beta as the sole variable explaining returns on stocks is dead” (Berg 1992).\n",
    "\n",
    "These empirical failures exposed a deeper theoretical problem: CAPM offered too narrow a representation of risk. Asset pricing models required additional dimensions to explain why some portfolios earned persistently higher returns than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Eugene Fama and Kenneth French aimed at capturing these missing dimensions, they developed the **Fama–French Three-Factor Model (1993)**, which looked at the two biggest anomalies for the CAPM, which was it's inability to explain small stock returns and the difference between value and growth stock returns. That's why in the Three Factor Model they augmented the market factor with size (SMB: small minus big) and value (HML: high minus low book-to-market):\n",

    "**Can the cross section of average stock returns be better explained by adding size and value factors to the market factor, thereby accounting for the persistent return premiums observed for small firms and high book to market firms?**\n",
    "\n",
    "After the Three-Factor Model (1993), Fama and French showed that the size and value factors **SMB** and **HML** captured important patterns that the CAPM could not explain. Small firms earned higher average returns than big firms (**size premium**), and high book to market firms earned higher returns than growth firms (**value premium**). In the three-factor framework, these effects appear through the parameters $( s_i )$ and $( h_i )$:\n",

    " $( s_i > 0 )$ for small firms and $( s_i < 0 )$ for big firms  \n",
    " $( h_i > 0 )$ for high book-to-market (value) firms\n",
    "\n",
    "But the model was still incomplete as evident by Novy-Marx (2012), Titman, Wei and Xie (2004) which say that the Three Factor is incomplete model for expected returns because its three factors miss much of the variation in average returns related to profitability and investment. \n",

    "**holding other characteristics constant**, a firm with higher expected profitability should have a higher required return $( r )$. Put differently, if two firms have similar book equity $( B )$ but one has higher expected earnings or cash flows, the valuation identity implies a positive link between profitability and expected returns. Empirically, portfolios sorted on operating profitability $(\\text{OP})$ showed exactly this pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, investment behavior carries information about expected returns. In standard steady state valuation, higher investment $( I_t )$ relative to assets $( A_t )$ (i.e., high asset growth) is typically associated with lower expected returns because firms invest more when their marginal $( q )$ is low. This motivates a negative relation between investment and expected returns. Fama and French operationalize this using the investment factor:\n",

We estimate factor loadings (aka the time-series regression slopes) using time-series OLS regressions of portfolio excess returns on factor returns, and we evaluate model performance through the main diagnostics used in Fama and French (1993, 2015): the magnitude and significance of intercepts, the signs and t-statistics of factor loadings, the regression $R^2$ values that indicate how much common variation the factors capture, and the joint GRS test of whether all alphas are zero. We also compare models using the variance of the estimated alphas $alpha_i$, and examine whether adding profitability and investment factors reduces the magnitude and cross-sectional variance of these pricing errors across the 25 portfolio and 32 portfolio sorts.\n",

    "(e) Main Findings: Authors’ Primary Empirical Results and Conclusions\n",
    "</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "The central empirical finding of Fama and French (2015) is that the Five-Factor Model offers a substantial improvement over the original Three-Factor Model. As they write, *“A five-factor model directed at capturing the size, value, profitability, and investment patterns in average stock returns performs better than the three-factor model of Fama and French (1993).”* The addition of profitability (RMW) and investment (CMA) factors sharply increases explanatory power and reduces the magnitude of pricing errors across most portfolio sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this improvement, the model is not a perfect description of the data. The GRS test rejects the model as a complete asset-pricing model, even though its economic fit is strong. The authors note, *“The GRS test easily rejects a five-factor model directed at capturing these patterns, but we estimate that the model explains between 71% and 94% of the cross-section variance of expected returns for the Size, B/M, OP, and Inv portfolios we examine.”* In other words, the model is statistically rejected but economically powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most notable findings is that the profitability and investment factors render the original value factor (HML) redundant. The authors state directly that, *“With the addition of profitability and investment factors, the value factor of the FF three-factor model becomes redundant for describing average returns in the sample we examine.”* This redundancy arises because HML’s high average return can be almost entirely explained by its exposures to the other factors:  \n",
    "*“…our results suggest that HML is a redundant factor in the sense that its high average return is fully captured by its exposures to $R_M - R_F$, SMB, and especially RMW and CMA.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "This result highlights the theoretical success of the new factors:  \n",
    "- **Profitability (RMW)** is strongly and positively related to average returns.  \n",
    "- **Investment (CMA)** is strongly negatively related to average returns (firms investing aggressively earn lower returns).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these two factors subsume the information HML was capturing about cash-flow risk and investment behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Five-Factor Model also has a clear and well-defined failure. Fama and French describe this as the model’s *“lethal”* problem: its inability to explain the very low average returns on certain small, distressed firms. These are portfolios made up of small firms that **invest heavily despite having low profitability**, and they consistently generate pricing errors that the model cannot account for. As the authors write, *“Portfolios of small stocks with negative exposures to RMW and CMA are the biggest asset pricing problem in four of the six sets of LHS portfolios examined here.”* They conclude, *“…we find that the lethal portfolios contain small stocks of firms that invest a lot despite low profitability.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main empirical outcomes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Five-Factor Model substantially improves upon the Three-Factor Model.  \n",
    "- Profitability (RMW) is a powerful, economically meaningful factor with a strong positive relation to returns.  \n",
    "- Investment (CMA) is also important, though it introduces challenges in capturing low-return, high-investment small firms.  \n",
    "- The value factor (HML) becomes redundant once RMW and CMA are introduced.  \n",
    "- Despite its successes, the model is still rejected statistically and fails most clearly for small, unprofitable, high-investment firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings form the basis of the paper’s contribution: a more complete but still imperfect model of the cross-section of expected returns.\n"

    "**First Gap: Shortcomings of the CAPM Model**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**The CAPM Anomaly**\n",
    "\n",
    "This prediction was contradicted by early empirical evidence (anomalies) showing that average returns were related to characteristics other than market beta. The Fama-French (1993) paper and subsequent literature documented that average returns showed patterns related to variables like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Firm Size**\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Leverage**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Book-to-Market Equity Ratio ($B/M$)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fama-French three-factor model was created to close this gap by adding the Size (SMB) and Value (HML) factors to the market factor ($R_M−R_F$) to capture the most prominent anomalies left unexplained by the CAPM.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second Gap: The Incompleteness of the Three-Factor Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "The second, and more direct, gap addressed by the Fama-French (2015) paper concerns the incompleteness of the three-factor model itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Profitability and Investment Challenge**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even after the development of the three-factor model, subsequent research continued to find variation in average stock returns that were left unexplained by the $R_M−R_F$, $SMB$, and $HML$ factors. This challenged the three-factor model's claim to capture all relevant cross-sectional variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors note that evidence began to accumulate showing that profitability and investment added to the description of average returns provided by $B/M$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Novy-Marx (2013) identified a proxy for expected profitability that showed a strong relation to average return.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aharoni, Grundy, and Zeng (2013) documented a weaker, but statistically reliable, relation between investment and average return.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The overall challenge was that \"much of the variation in average returns related to profitability and investment is left unexplained by the three-factor model\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The research challenge posed by the underlying valuation equation (the Dividend Discount Model) was to \"identify proxies for expected earnings and investments\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Closing the Gap:**\n",
    "The Fama-French (2015) paper closes this second gap by creating and testing a model that explicitly adds these two factors—Profitability (RMW) and Investment (CMA)—to the existing three factors. The explicit goal was to capture the profitability and investment patterns that the three-factor model missed."

    "\n",
    "**Sample Size:** There are no discrepancies in sample size. The replication sample was successfully restricted to the exact 606-month window (July 1963–December 2013) used in the original analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Means and Distributions:** While the sample size is identical, the statistical moments (means and standard deviations) exhibit slight variations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Means:** The means are highly consistent. \n",
    "$R_M-R_F$ and $CMA$ match exactly (0.50 and 0.33 respectively). $SMB$, $HML$, and $RMW$ deviate by only 0.01% per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standard Deviations:** The distributions show slightly more variance between the two datasets. Notably, the replication sample shows a lower standard deviation for $HML$ (2.79 vs 2.88) and a higher standard deviation for $RMW$ (2.25 vs 2.14).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential Reasons for Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the time period (N=606) is identical, the differences in statistics are not due to the inclusion of new months (e.g., post-2013 data). Instead, these discrepancies are likely attributed to Vintage Data Updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fama-French data library is dynamic. The authors and data providers (CRSP/Compustat) occasionally refine the historical data used to construct the factors. Common reasons for historical updates include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Restated Financials:** Companies may restate historical earnings or book values years after the fact. As the Fama-French factors rely on sorting firms based on Book-to-Market and Operating Profitability, retroactive changes to accounting data can shift a stock from one portfolio (e.g., \"Weak Profitability\") to another (\"Robust Profitability\"), slightly altering the historical return of the factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Database Corrections:** CRSP or Compustat may correct errors in share counts or prices in legacy data, which affects the market capitalization weights used to construct the value-weighted portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in the original 2015 paper represents a \"vintage\" of the database from 2014. The replication uses the most current version of the historical data, resulting in the minor statistical deviations observed in the comparison table."

    "The paper's correlation values were obtained at **table 4 panel C** under the **2 x 3 factors table**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview: Successful Replication\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation matrices are remarkably similar, confirming that you have successfully restricted your sample to the correct 1963–2013 period. Unlike the descriptive statistics which showed slight variances in standard deviation, several correlation coefficients in your plot are exact or near-exact matches to the original paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "This high degree of alignment validates your replication methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Key Similarities (Economic Intuition Confirmed)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important economic relationships identified by Fama and French are perfectly preserved in your replication:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Value-Investment Link ($HML$ vs. $CMA$):**\n",
    "    - **Our Plot:** 0.70\n",
    "    - **Original Paper:** 0.70\n",
    "    - **Significance:** This is an exact match. This high positive correlation is a central finding of the paper, indicating that \"high B/M value firms tend to be low investment firms\" (conservative investors).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Market vs. Investment ($Market$ vs. $CMA$):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Our Plot:** -0.39\n",
    "    - **Original Paper:** -0.39\n",
    "    - **ignificance:** Another exact match. This confirms that firms with conservative investment strategies (high CMA) tend to act as a hedge, moving opposite to the broad market.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Size vs. Profitability ($SMB$ vs. $RMW$):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Our Plot:** -0.34\n",
    "    - **Original Paper:** -0.36\n",
    "    - **Significance:** Both matrices show a strong negative relationship, confirming that small firms generally have lower profitability than large firms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Minor Differences (Data Vintage Effects)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are small deviations in the magnitude of some correlations, likely due to the \"vintage\" data updates (historical corrections to CRSP/Compustat data) discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Profitability vs. Investment ($RMW$ vs. $CMA$):\n",
    "    - **Our Plot:** -0.05\n",
    "    - **Original Paper:** -0.11\n",
    "    - **Observation:** This is the largest relative difference. Your modern data vintage suggests that the inverse relationship between profitability and investment (i.e., profitable firms investing aggressively) is slightly weaker than originally estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Market vs. Value ($Market$ vs. $HML$):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Our Plot:** -0.27\n",
    "    - **Original Paper:** -0.30\n",
    "    - **Observation:** The negative relationship is slightly less pronounced in your sample, though the direction is identical.\n",
