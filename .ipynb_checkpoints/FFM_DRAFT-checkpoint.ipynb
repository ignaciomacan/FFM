    "# 1. Original Study Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "## (a) Research Question: Clearly state the paper’s main research question and economic Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern asset-pricing began with a simple premise: if markets are competitive and information flows freely, prices should adjust to news and leave no predictable profit opportunities. This idea is what became the **Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)**. EMH emerged in the 1950s and 60s out of early empirical work showing that stock returns had almost no autocorrelation, suggesting prices behave like a fair game responding only to new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "A decade later, Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965) formalized the first equilibrium model linking risk to expected returns: the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)**. Its prediction was:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1) CAPM Formula**  \n",
    "\\[$\n",
    "E[R_i] - R_f = \\beta_i\\,(E[R_M] - R_f)\n",
    "$\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "With **beta** as the sole predictor of cross-sectional differences in average returns. For 20 years this model remained empirically reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "But as Fama repeatedly emphasizes, CAPM’s “golden age” was short. By the early 1980s and into the 1990s, empirical papers accumulated showing that beta alone could not explain average returns sorted on firm **size** (Banz 1981), **earnings-price ratios** (Basu 1977), **leverage** (Bhandari 1988), or **book-to-market** (Rosenberg, Reif & Lanstein 1985). Additional patterns such as long-term reversals (DeBondt & Thaler 1985) and the January effect (Keim 1983) reinforced the conclusion that CAPM missed persistent dimensions of return variance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These anomalies eventually shifted professional consensus. As the *New York Times* summarized in 1992—reflecting the conclusions of Fama and French—“beta as the sole variable explaining returns on stocks is dead.” (Berg 1992)\n",
    "\n",
    "These empirical failures exposed a deeper theoretical problem: CAPM offered too narrow a representation of risk. Asset-pricing models required additional dimensions to explain why some portfolios earned persistently higher returns than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Eugene Fama and Kenneth French aimed at capturing these missing dimensions, they developed the **Fama–French Three-Factor Model (1993)**. In it they augmented the market factor with size (SMB: small minus big) and value (HML: high minus low book-to-market):\n",
    "\n",
    "**(2) Fama–French Three-Factor Formula**  \n",
    "\\[$\n",
    "R_i - R_f = \\alpha_i + \\beta_i (R_M - R_f) + s_i\\,\\text{SMB} + h_i\\,\\text{HML} + \\varepsilon_i\n",
    "$\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "What the Three-Factor Model aims to answer is: can size (SMB) and value (HML) jointly explain the cross-section of average returns better than CAPM?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "After the Three-Factor Model (1993), Fama and French showed that SMB and HML captured important patterns that CAPM could not explain. But the model was still incomplete: it summarized the data, yet it did not explain **why** these patterns existed. Subsequent work showed that **profitability** and **investment** were also strongly related to average returns and were not absorbed by the three factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation for revisiting the model comes directly from the **dividend discount model**, which expresses a stock’s price as the present value of expected future dividends:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3) Dividend Discount Model**  \n",
    "\\[$\n",
    "P_t = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{E_t[D_{t+j}]}{(1+r)^j}\n",
    "$\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The DDM can be rewritten in terms of future earnings and changes in book equity:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(4) \\(M_t\\)**  \n",
    "\\[$\n",
    "M_t = \\frac{B_{t+1} - B_t + D_{t+1}}{E_t[R_{t+1}]}\n",
    "$\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies three core relationships:\n",
    "- A higher book-to-market ratio is associated with **higher expected returns**  \n",
    "- Higher expected profitability is associated with **higher expected returns**  \n",
    "- Higher expected investment (growth in book equity) is associated with **lower expected returns**\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads directly to the research question in the **Five-Factor Model of Fama and French (2014):**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **“Do profitability and investment add explanatory power beyond the three-factor model?”**\n",
    "\n",
    "The economic interpretation is straightforward: if expected returns are tied to how firms earn profits and reinvest capital, then an empirical model that omits these drivers is incomplete. The purpose of the five-factor model is to test whether incorporating **profitability (RMW)** and **investment (CMA)** produces a model better aligned with underlying expected returns.\n"
